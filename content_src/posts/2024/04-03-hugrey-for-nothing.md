I need to write something 
I just want to sedate and numb these this conscious thoughts.
I do this to be be ok with myselfe, just standing by, doing nothing for no one other than myself.
I fill my ego with delusions of selflessness and compassion I never gave away but still feel and crave the dopamine from its effect on me.
My pride swells of bravery of a battle I never fought in. I think how much better would have been had I died beside you being what I belive to be my authentic self. I'm still hungrey. What the living fuck am I?

I wish I could die like you, but I never lived like you so I will never know.
