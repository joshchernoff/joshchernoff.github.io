## Little wiggles

When I think about music, I feel something that is more than just a conscious thought. This almost instinctual sensation moves me on a physical level. I can either choose to ignore it or harmonize with it. I say "or" because for people like me, it's not always possible to ignore it. There are times that even if I somehow manage to ignore it, I still harmonize with it.

Little wiggles, bigger wiggles, subordinate wiggles, pulses, signals, oscillations, waves, patterns, beats, melodies, orbits, days, nights, birth then death, breathing in, breathing out.

How far must you stand beside yourself before you see the ritual of the ego?

These are the introspections of thoughts that I've found a space to have thanks to music.

Some believe music started more as a mantra, and that we have never really moved that far from that original use.

I think listening to music is a subconscious or directly conscious behavior to modulate yourself and perspective. Just like why some people take stimulants to accelerate their thoughts or why others take sedatives who wish to hide from their own thoughts.

I found that the medium of media I consume more than anything else is music. I surround myself with music almost every moment I'm in solitude. I've listened to almost every genre there is, but I find myself listening to the same style of music, and I know exactly why. I'm using music to cope with what I'm seeing in the world today.

## Thank you Leon Vynehall, I guess you should send me a medical bill.

In around late 2019 my life changed significantly and I have since become almost disabled. 
I've yet to claim disablity at current moment because I'm not fucking done yet and I'll give up when I'm dead. Regardless of what life has instore for me I find I have constructed a lifestyle around listening to music that not only helps me get into the mood for any aspect of activities but I've most often found it to by my therapist.

## Movements is profound. 

I don't know what to say other than it still works for me. Just like a light switch.
From the horns to the piano this track irons my thoughts flat, like a sedative for the soul.

## I'm not a creative, I create space for creativity to happen.

It's the time and the place. If we can't control the time, than we go to controlling the place. 
The state of our mind is a place in time. We choose to be happy or sad based on the place we choose to leave our state of mind in. Since time has great inflaunce of the place we seek to find our way to ride the wave as they say. Harmanizing and synchronizing we ride the line and follow the patterns. 

> The coming together of inner and outer events in time means that a person is internally prepared to meet an external event by rendering it possible to perceive and act in a way that corresponds to its nature and its place in the world. 
- Carl Jung

## What we do 
It's just sounds at the end of the day but it's saying something to me.
