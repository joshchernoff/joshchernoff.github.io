I live in Oregon, I voted yes for messsue 110. It was the bill that decrimnilzed small ammounts of drugs and was meant to create more rehabs and treatment centers. Without even trying to address the issue my state is now undoing my vote.

If you voted on messure 110 then you should know your vote no longer matters and here is proof that it never will. 

So to not keep lying to myself and pertented that cops will be held to standards and landlord's greed wont make everyone homeless and policitans will uphold my mother fucking vote, I'm just gonna no longer vote. Here's my vote. Fuck all of you.

* Fuck the establishment! Lib and Republican alike, fuck you both!
* Fuck the police, you incompentent limp dicks go back to Camas.
* Fuck the pussy ass middle class, your ass will be on the streets too doing drugs soon enought.
* Fuck you all. 

I hate my home state Oregon. All we do is tax and grift the poor and celibrate and gift the rich.

You all bread home grown terrorits and you deserve everything horrible that is happening.

Lets update our state slogan.
Strangulat propriis manibus. (He strangles himself with his own hands.)
