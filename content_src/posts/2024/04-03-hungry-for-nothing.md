I need to write something.  
I just want to sedate and numb these conscious thoughts.  
I do this to be be ok with myselfe, just standing by, doing nothing for no one other than myself.  
I fill my ego with delusions of selflessness and compassion I never gave away but still feel and crave the dopamine from its effect on me.  

My pride swells with bravery of a battle I never fought in.  
I think how much better it would have been had I died beside you being what I belive to be my authentic self.  

I wish I could die like you, but I've never lived like you so I will never know.
