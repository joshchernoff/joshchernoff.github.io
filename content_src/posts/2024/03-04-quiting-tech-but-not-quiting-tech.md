2001, That was when I started writing websites. Back then I used flash and php. Now a days my tech stack looks really different. In this time I've worked for many large corparations. Osborn and Barr, CMD, Mattel, Food Network, Macy's, Disney. 

Never again will I willing give my skills as a programmer to a less deserving organation who is not focued on solving the issues of my community. I will also give my skills at substatally less rate and at times probono rather than feed into a system of greed.

I'm done working for conpanies. This time I'm only going to work for people.
